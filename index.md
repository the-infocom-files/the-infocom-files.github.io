## What is here?
The latest source code of each Infocom game has been imported from Andrew Plotkin's [Obsessively Complete Infocom Catalog](https://eblong.com/infocom/) as a starting point for building working games using the [ZILF](https://zilf.io/) toolset.

## What will be done with it?

1. Remove files which are not involved in building the games. They aren't needed here.

2. Build the games if possible, fix problems if not. Identify unfixable games and reasons why.

3. Fix bugs. There are lists of known Infocom bugs on the Internet and we might find some new ones.

4. Add Enhancements. There may be some mileage in creating modern versions of the games.

## Why?

The Infocom source code is of great interest to fans and scholars of old-school text adventures like ourselves.
